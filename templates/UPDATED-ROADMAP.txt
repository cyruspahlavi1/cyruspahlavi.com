OPERATING PRINCIPLES:
• Legality (rule of law, due process, constitutional constraints)
• Non-violence (peaceful political change, opposition to terrorism)
• Equal citizenship (one civil law for all Iranians)

• Protection of civilians (priority on preventing harm)
• Accountability (documentation, evidence, independent investigation)
• Regional peace (non-aggression, respect for borders, cooperation)
