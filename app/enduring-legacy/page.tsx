            The Pahlavi name is inseparable from Iran&apos;s modern history—its achievements, its wounds, and its unfinished work. This legacy guides a commitment to a state restrained by law and protected by citizenship.

            <p className="mt-4 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
              Under Pahlavi reign, Iran built the foundations of a civil state: schools and universities expanded; national institutions were strengthened; and the law began to recognize citizens—especially women—as full participants in the life of the nation.

            <p className="mt-4 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
              Across centuries and across communities, Cyrus the Great is remembered for restraint after victory—for restoring sanctuaries and returning displaced peoples to rebuild their lives. In Jewish memory, he is honored for enabling the end of the Babylonian captivity and the return to rebuild in Jerusalem. The Cyrus Cylinder has been invoked by many as a global symbol of human dignity and fundamental human rights.
